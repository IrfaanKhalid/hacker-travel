# Contibuting to trvl

## Short Links to Important Resources:

* [Always feel free to open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/IrfaanKhalid/trvl/issues)

## Testing
* Testing is done the rote way - try different options and see what works. An automated test suite is unplanned but could
certainly happen at some point in the future.

## Development environment details
* You can develop in any OS as long as you have node.js and npm installed.

## Mode of Transport Plugins
Our goal is to manage as many modes of transport as possible. Hackathons right now offer very few multi-modal transport routes: we would like to. Currently, we have implemented driving and flights. We expect that other hackathon organizers (and us!) will add more plugins. Make sure that yours includes a simple callback and that all its modules are in a single folder
