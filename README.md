[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/VandyHacks/trvl.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A web application made to simplify organizing hackathon travel logistics.
  * Determine how feasible travel reimbursements are for hackathon attendees.
  * Offer your attendees different travel options that are approved by you, the organizers.
  * Keep track of all travel reimbursements for your event in a streamlined interface.

## Installation and Usage
  * To install and use trvl, you'll need to have node and npm installed. 
  * You'll need a file called `config.js` in `/server/src`. The file in that directory called `example_config.js` provides a handy template.

```
    git clone https://github.com/IrfaanKhalid/trvl.git
    cd trvl/
    npm install
    node ./server/index.js
    <Navigate to localhost:3000 to see trvl in action.>
