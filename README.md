## A web application make to simplify organizing hackathon travel logistics.

### Hackathon organizing is hard.
Between ensuring a seamless hacker experience, securing enough sponsorship to host a great event, and 
actually having the logistical backend to pull off the affair, the challenge organizing a hackathon presents
is unique and challenging.

As organizers of a very special event called VandyHacks, we want to make our jobs easier so we can focus
on hosting the best hackathon possible. That being said, having to manually parse through travel reimbursements,
coordinate buses and other vehicles with the risk of human error making a mistake, and finding the time
to actually do all of this by hand is a daunting task we'd like to streamline for ourselves and the
organizing community at large.

### That's where trvl comes in.
trvl is a web application whose primary goal is to ease the lives of hackathon organizers.
Logistics is tough - it pertains to securing a venue, transporting attendees, and feeding lots of hungry
mouths. trvl focused on the second task of the logistics team - actually getting attendees to the 
event.

### Okay, so how exactly do your attendees get there?
- Car - People can drive themselves if they have access to a vehicle.
- Bus - We send out buses to schools with many interested applicants.
- Flight - In some cases, we can fly attendees out for our event!

Coordinating all of this is tedious. trvl() offers an interface to let hackathon 
attendees make travel plans and hackathon organizers leave the heavy lifting of organizing
travel to the application and simply view what plans exist.

### trvl() does a few things.
- Given a starting location, figures out how much of a gas reimbursement an attendee can receive.
- Shows available flights, and lets attendees know how much of the ticket can be subsidized.
- Neatly organizes all of this info for organizers.

### How is trvl built?
trvl was built with love using Firebase, Express.js, and React.js at HackIllinois 2017.

### License
Yes! trvl is built under the MIT License - feel free to fork this repo whenever you'd like. We want to 
see trvl grow and become a tool that can benefit the entire community.
