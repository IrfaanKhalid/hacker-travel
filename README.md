# Hacker.travel()
## A web application to make organizing travel logistics for hackathon organizers and attendees simple.

### Hackathon organizing is hard.
Between ensuring a seamless hacker experience, securing enough sponsorship to host a great event, and 
actually having the logistical backend to pull off the affair, the process can be cumbersome.

As organizers of a very special event called VandyHacks, we want to make our jobs easier so we can focus
on hosting the best hackathon possible. That being said, having to manually parse through travel reimbursements,
coordinate buses and other vehicles with the risk of human error making a mistake, and finding the time
to actually do all of this by hand is an incredible challenge we'd like to mitigate for ourselves
as we mature as event organizers.

### That's where Hacker.travel() comes in.
Hacker.travel() is a web application whose primary goal is to streamline the experience of organizing a hackathon.
Logistics is tough - it pertains to securing a venue, transporting attendees, and feeding lots of hungry
mouths. Hacker.travel() focused on the second task of the logistics team - actually getting attendees to the 
event.

The status quo of the collegiate hackathon is to provide everything a participant might need free of charge.

### Free, you say?
Yes, free! This is important because it makes sure anyone who wants to attend, learn, and be a better
developer has the opportunity to do so. This includes making sure everyone can actually get to the event.

### Okay, so how do you get your attendees from point A to point B?
- Car - People can drive themselves, but gas prices add up.
- Bus - We send out buses to schools with many interested applicants.
- Flight - In some cases, we can fly attendees out for our event!

Coordinating all of this is tedious. Hacker.travel() offers an interface to let hackathon 
attendees make travel plans and hackathon organizers leave the heavy lifting of organizing
travel to the application and simply view what plans exist.

### Hacker.travel() does a few things.
- Given a starting location, figures out how much of a reimbursement for gas an attendee can get if choosing to drive
- Tracks RSVPs for buses - spots are often limited! - and keep track of buses en route to the event using GPS beacons.
- Offers available flights that organizers can approve/deny, and lets attendees know how much of the ticket can be subsidized.

### How'd you build it?
Hacker.travel() is built with Node, Express, Firebase, and React.

### Can I try this out and contribute to it?
